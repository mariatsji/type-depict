# type-depict.io

A repository for visualizing Haskell type signatures

That is, it can [draw a visualization of a Haskell type](https://www.type-depict.io)

The core idea is representing any Haskell type level signature as a combination of Connections, Embellishments, Groups and Dots

## Known limitations:
Cant parse PolyKinds or FunDeps signatures
